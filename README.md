# BooleanModel_SOCE
This repository contains the pipelines to simulate the boolean network for SOCE/BRAFi network. 
The code for BooleanModel_SOCE was written in Python2 virtual environment on a Windows 10 system using PyCharm. The Library majorly used is Booleannet (https://github.com/ialbert/booleannet) for the simulations. 
The pipelines simulate the boolean network of 14 nodes depicting the interaction between BRAF module and SOCE (Store-operated Calcium Entry) module.
